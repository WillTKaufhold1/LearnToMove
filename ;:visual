# LearnToMove

## Objective 

Propose candidate monomers for auxetic materials, to be built with DNA. 

Idea is to use wireframe DNA origami to create precise patten of struts and joins, which are synthesized bottom up. 

Workflow is:

Design monomers using LearnToMove -> validate simulation of monomers using MRDNA / oxDNA -> Build monomers at Carlos's lab -> Assemble materials back at Imperial.

## LearnToMove Model

The objective of the model is to provide the simplest possible description of wireframe DNA origami that captures mechanical properties. Finite element analysis / nucleotide level descriptions are too computaionally intensive to be useful evaluation steps in optimization. 

One alternative is to describe the system as a set of edges which represent single helices, and a set of nodes, which represent junctions between helices. The junctions can be represented as beads, with a tabulated potential between adjacent nodes which encodes the repulsive effect of the double helix.


## Implementation 

Implementation of the evaluator is in GPU accelerate HOOMD-BLUE. Implementation of the optimizer is in Python3. 

### Units 

Fundamental units are distance / energy / mas
